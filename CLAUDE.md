## Database Schema (Key Tables)

All tables include `school_id` for multi-tenant isolation. RLS is enabled on all tables.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `schools` | Top-level tenants |
| `branches` | Sub-locations per school |
| `school_years` | Academic years; one `active` per school (enforced by unique index) |
| `profiles` | Extends `auth.users`; roles: `super_admin`, `school_admin`, `teacher`, `parent` |
| `classes` | Scoped to `school_id` + `school_year_id` |
| `class_teachers` | Many-to-many: class ↔ teacher profile |
| `students` | Student records per school |
| `guardians` | Multiple guardians per student; `is_primary` flag |
| `enrollments` | Student ↔ class ↔ school_year; statuses: `inquiry`, `waitlisted`, `enrolled`, `withdrawn`, `completed` |
| `attendance_records` | Per student per class per date; unique constraint prevents duplicates |
| `parent_updates` | Class feed posts by teachers |
| `billing_records` | Monthly billing per student; statuses: `unpaid`, `partial`, `paid`, `overdue` |
| `payments` | Multiple payments per billing record; methods: `cash`, `bank_transfer`, `gcash`, `maya`, `card`, `other` |
| `holidays` | No-class days per school |
| `events` | School events; `applies_to`: `all`, `class`, `selected` |
| `event_rsvps` | Student RSVP per event |
| `enrollment_inquiries` | Lead pipeline; statuses: `inquiry`, `assessment_scheduled`, `waitlisted`, `offered_slot`, `enrolled`, `not_proceeding` |
| `online_class_sessions` | Scheduled online sessions per class |
| `progress_categories` | Observation dimensions (7 default: Participation, Social Skills, etc.) |
| `progress_observations` | Per-student ratings; `visibility`: `internal_only` or `parent_visible` |

### Enums

```
school_year_status: draft | active | archived
user_role: super_admin | school_admin | teacher | parent
enrollment_status: inquiry | waitlisted | enrolled | withdrawn | completed
attendance_status: present | late | absent | excused
billing_status: unpaid | partial | paid | overdue
payment_method_type: cash | bank_transfer | gcash | maya | card | other
payment_status_type: pending | confirmed | failed | refunded
event_applies_to: all | class | selected
rsvp_status: going | not_going | maybe
inquiry_status: inquiry | assessment_scheduled | waitlisted | offered_slot | enrolled | not_proceeding
online_class_status: scheduled | live | completed | cancelled
progress_rating: emerging | developing | consistent | advanced
observation_visibility: internal_only | parent_visible
```

### Seed Data (from 001_additions.sql)

- School ID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` — "Bright Kids Learning and Tutorial Center"
- Branch: "Main Branch"
- School Year ID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002` — "SY 2025–2026" (active)
- 7 default progress categories pre-inserted

---

## SchoolContext

Available everywhere inside `(dashboard)/` via `useSchoolContext()`:

```ts
schoolId: string | null
schoolName: string
activeYear: { id, name, startDate, endDate, status } | null
userId: string | null
userRole: 'super_admin' | 'school_admin' | 'teacher' | 'parent' | null
userName: string
loading: boolean
refresh: () => void   // call after changing school-level settings
```

---

## Supabase Setup (New Project)

1. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in SQL Editor
2. Run `supabase/migrations/001_additions.sql` in SQL Editor
3. Sign up as admin user via `/login`
4. In SQL Editor, assign the admin to BK school:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles
     SET school_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
         role      = 'school_admin',
         full_name = 'Your Name'
   WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
   ```
5. Add sample classes if needed (see commented SQL in 001_additions.sql)

## What Is NOT Yet Built

### High Priority (Core Features)
- [x] **Multi-school / Super Admin panel** — done: schools list, trial management, create school, impersonation
- [x] **Trial system** — done: 14-day trial, banner, read-only on expiry
- [x] **Academic Period** — done: CRUD in Settings, linked to school year
- [x] **Tuition configuration** — done: per-level, per-period pricing with monthly breakdown
- [x] **Fee types** — done: CRUD in Finance Setup
- [x] **Discounts & promos** — done: fixed, percentage, credit types; scoped presets
- [x] **Credits system** — done: issue credits, track applied vs outstanding
- [ ] **Resource / Document Hub** — file uploads, categorized downloads for parents
- [ ] **Online classes** — wire `online-classes` page to Supabase (currently static)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **RSVP for events** — per-student RSVP UI
- [ ] **Field trip / event fees** — link fees to events, per-student opt-in
- [ ] **Parent portal / view** — parent-specific read-only dashboard
- [ ] **Waitlist management UI** — explicit waitlist queue, promote-to-enrolled flow
- [ ] **Sibling enrollment** — link students as siblings, auto-apply sibling discount

### Future / Nice to Have
- [ ] **Demo school** — pre-seeded demo data for walkthroughs
- [ ] **Branch management** — multi-branch per school
- [ ] **Push notifications / reminders**
- [ ] **PWA icons** — icon-192.png / icon-512.png missing from public/
- [ ] **Role-based UI gating** — hide admin-only actions from teachers/parents
- [ ] **Tighten RLS policies** — per-role write policies (currently broad "school member" policies)

---

## Schema (002 Migration — Implemented)

All implemented in `supabase/migrations/002_super_admin_trial_periods_tuition.sql`:

- `schools` — added `trial_start_date`, `trial_end_date`, `trial_status`
- `academic_periods` — new table (school_id, school_year_id, name, dates, is_active)
- `classes` — added `academic_period_id` (nullable FK)
- `billing_records` — added `academic_period_id` (nullable FK)
- `fee_types` — new table (CRUD per school)
- `tuition_configs` — new table (per academic_period × level, unique constraint)
- `discounts` — new table (type: fixed/percentage/credit, scope: 5 presets)
- `student_credits` — new table (issued credit amounts per student)
- `billing_discounts` — new table (applied discount snapshot on billing records)
- `is_super_admin()` SQL function for RLS bypass
- Super admin SELECT bypass policies on all 21 existing tables

---

## Coding Conventions

- All pages are `"use client"` with `useEffect` + Supabase client for data fetching
- Always scope queries with `school_id` from `useSchoolContext()`
- Always scope school-year-specific queries with `activeYear?.id`
- Use `PageSpinner` for full-page loading, `ErrorAlert` for error states
- Use `Modal` component for add/edit forms
- Filter/search is client-side on fetched data (no server-side pagination yet)
- `formatCurrency(n)` — Philippine Peso formatting
- `formatTime(t)` — 12-hour time string
- `getInitials(name)` — avatar initials
